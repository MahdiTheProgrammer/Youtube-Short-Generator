# Youtube-Short-Generator
### In this repo I am trying to build a fully automated pipline for genereating youtube shorts.
## Voice Generation
Tortoise library is used for generating the voice and the codes are available in 
```
tortoise_gen.py
```
## Picture Generation
Each generated short includes a few AI generated pictures. For picture generation I am using:
```
stable-diffusion-v1-5
```
model. The code is available in:
```
imgaer.py
```
## Background video
You can choose the background video by moving it in the 
```
vids/
```
directory. 

## Text Generation
I am trying to use RAG with an LLM but the code is not yet ready. For now there is 
```
story_inputs.py
```
where you can write your stories and prompts for images. <br>

## Automation
This code is not yet fully automated because the text generation is not yet ready. But I will add the codes to repo in the near future.
